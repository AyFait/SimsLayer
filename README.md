FEA simulation of 3D-Printed Parts\
\
This idea is birthed when I asked myself if there are efficient simulation tools specifically designed for 3D-Printed parts. Because there is no doubt of assumption that they have entirely different mechanical properties due to the manufauring process involed\
\
> Why 3D-Printed Parts needs specialized simulation tools:\
While general Finite Element Analysis (FEA) software can be used, dedicated additive manufacturing (AM) software is far superior for this specific purpose because it understands:\
= Layer-by-layer material addition rather than assuming the entire part exists at once.\
= Directional material properties (anisotropy), especially for fiber-reinforced filaments.\
= Thermal history of the part throughout the build.\
= Structural integrity as it relates to directional oading due to layer-by-layer orientation of the part(s)\
\
These is particularly vital for metal 3D printing, where material costs are high and failure is expensive!\
